            <p style="padding: 18px;text-align: justify;">Ai is a young girl of average height and petite figure whose most distinguishing feature is her <span style="font-weight: bold;color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" class="click" tabindex="0">heterochromia</span>, which causes her right eye to be a yellowish-amber and her left eye to be a slightly darker shade of ocean blue. She has dark blue hair which she wears in a fluffy bob cut with a long ahoge swooping towards her left side. Above her right eye is a yellow triangular hair clip while her left eye is naturally covered up by her bangs.</p>
            <div class="eye"></div>
            <p style="padding: 18px;text-align: justify;">Ai is often seen wearing a bright yellow hoodie with a sunflower design near the pockets of her hoodie and volleyball shorts when outside. She wears a striped light-pink and light-purple tank top at home. When attending school, she wears the school uniform; a dark navy jumper and green tie. Her shoes of choice are white and blue platform sneakers.</p>
            <p style="padding: 18px;text-align: justify;">Ai is generally seen with a calm and/or blank expression on her face, but has been shown to get quite emotional and expressive when in high-pressure situations. Ai also seems to come out of her shell with her friends, and often wears a small smile around them.</p>

                    <p class="title">Personality</p>
                    <p>Ai is a generally introverted girl who spends most of her time alone. She dislikes being around people who have hurt her friends and is extremely brave and protective towards people that she cares about. Initially, she did not think having friends was important and put in little effort to make them. However, she eventually made friends with a transfer student named Koito Nagase, who was similarly ostracized by her peers.</p>
                    <p>Being a victim of bullying, Ai is extremely self-deprecating. When Koito committed suicide, Ai blamed herself, and committed herself to saving her. After rescuing Kurumi Saijo from the Seeno Evils and her Wonder Killer, a strong sense of determination and perseverance begins to show in Ai as she declares that she will continue saving people until she can bring Koito back to life.</p>
                    <p>Ai is often seen reminiscing about the loss of Koito, and suffers from the crushing feeling of guilt from it. She is shown to have grown from it, becoming set on bringing her friend back. Indirectly, she also spawns a sense of helpfulness and kindness, seen when she helps Minami Suzuhara in confronting her inner fears and worries. This side of her is also seen in the real world with Neiru Aonuma, offering to be her friend to overcome both of their loneliness.</p>
